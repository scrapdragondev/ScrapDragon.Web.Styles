- **Dark Mode:** `{AUTO_GENERATED_THEME_NAME}-scrapdragon-dark.css`
- **Light Mode:** `{AUTO_GENERATED_THEME_NAME}-scrapdragon-light.css`

### Example:
- `dx.generic.scrapdragon-light.css` (Generic Light Theme)
- `dx.fluent.scrapdragon-dark.css` (Fluent Dark Theme)

## üìå Usage
To use a theme in your ScrapDragon Web application, include the CSS file in your HTML:
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/scrapdragondev/ScrapDragon.Web.Styles@main/css/dx.fluent.scrapdragon-dark.css">
```

## üìÇ Icons and Fonts
This repository also includes a set of icons and fonts located in the `icons/` and `fonts/` folders.

### üîπ How to Use:
Since browsers may block cross-origin requests in CSS (when using a CDN), it's recommended to **copy the `icons/` and `fonts/` folder into your own project** and reference them locally.

### üì• Steps to Copy:
1. Download the `icons/` and `fonts/` folder from the repository.
2. Place it inside your project's **public assets** folder (e.g., `/wwwroot/icons/` for .NET projects).
